2. Memory leak on OutOfMemory
  well, well...

3. WinA : WM_MOUSELEAVE, WinB: WM_MOUSEMOVE message sequential maybe* orderless. make UIViewport's Event_MouseEnter/Event_MouseLeave orderless
  you should handle both situations.
   * : if mouse move fast as you can(just 1 frame), you will get WM_MOUSEMOVE(B) at first, then WM_MOUSELEAVE(A)

4.
