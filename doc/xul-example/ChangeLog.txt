The XUL Periodic Table's contents were downloaded from 
http://www.hevanet.com/acorbin/xul and modified slightly. The images 
were missing from the download so I replaced them with other images. 
There were a few typos in the XUL files that prevented them from 
rendering properly so I fixed them. The source tab in the viewer 
actually looks at whatever is in the .txt version of the specific XUL 
file you're looking at. These txt files may or may not reflect the 
actual source. I only updated the .txt files corresponding to the xul 
files I edited and may have missed one or two. It's best to look at the 
actual xul files in a text editor if you run into trouble though, the 
source tab looks just awesome and it's probably ok. 

In the past this content could be viewed in firefox like any other 
webpage. That is no longer possible, so the content has been changed 
into a XUL Runner application. 

If you want to use the bat files to launch this application on XUL 
Runner you will need to adjust the paths in them to suit your system and 
copy XUL Periodic Table.exe into the same folder where xulrunner.exe is. 
Of course you can launch this app by calling <path to 
xulrunner>\xulrunner.exe --app application.ini from this directory but, 
you won't get the fancy icon and convenient clicky bat file. 

All XUL Periodic Table.exe is, is the xulrunner-stub.exe with an 
application icon injected into it using resourcehacker. The application 
icon is easy to create using gimp, creating each layer of the image as 
the different sizes of icon, and exporting the image as an icon. Use the 
resource hacker to pull the appicon out of the exe and look at it in 
gimp. It's really easy to make.

You can also create shortcuts to the bat files and modify the 
shortcuts's properties so they'll use the icon from XUL Periodic 
Table.exe. You can specify that the bat file is to be launched minimized 
so it doesn't flash across the screen. 

Have fun!
